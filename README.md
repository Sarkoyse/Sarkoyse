- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sarkoyse
- 👀 I’m interested in personal privacy and anonymity while browsing non social websites.  Intrusions that prevent such basic privacy features available to all threatens trust, compliance and human decency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that no one can be trusted...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that circumvent the UI in such a way that deceives the user into believing they are using a generic version of an application, when in fact they are not - the app is deployed via policy and violates all local, state and federal privacy regulations on personal devices. If you want to violate privacy on citizens without cause, go to China or vote in communists public officials.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
